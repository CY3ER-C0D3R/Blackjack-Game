The program works on python 2.6.6 and uses a few different files in order to save the game data:
Scores.db -> Database to save the scores of each player
Blackjack Instruction.txt -> game instructions
about.txt -> this file
make sure all of them are in the same directory (default dir: C:\\Python26\\)

*Note: the program uses ttk for the scrollbars and the scores table. You must install ttk before running the program.
